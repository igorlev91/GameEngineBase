![Alt text](https://github.com/igorlev91/GameEngineTest/tree/main/VSCodeSnippets/screen.jpg "Image")
-- The basic functionality of the project browser for creating and loading game projects. I implemented the creation of game projects from projects templates. The user can now select a template, choose a name and a location for their new game project and create the project.
- Implemented the game entity and transform component classes that user will be using in the editor. These are basically the UI representation of game objects and their components in the game engine.
- Working on the message log control
